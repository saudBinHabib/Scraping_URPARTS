# Scrapy implementation of the Spider for Scraping the Manufacturing Parts.

Scrapy is an application framework for crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.

Even though Scrapy was originally designed for web scraping, it can also be used to extract data using APIs (such as Amazon Associates Web Services) or as a general purpose web crawler.

In this Repo, I have just implementend one Spider for displaying, how to scrape data from the multiple linked website, This is a more adanvanced Spider because of it's ability to scrape from multiple pages.
